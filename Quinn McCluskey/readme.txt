Rename the input file to "inputs.txt" before running

I have uploaded 3 files:
1. pt1+2.cpp: takes input from file writes minterms to output.txt and also generates and displays corresponding reduced expression
2. pt1.cpp: takes input from file and generates the corresponding minterms/maxterms and writes minterms to output.txt files
3. pt2.cpp: takes minterms as input from the user and generates the reduced expression
